# Welcome to my Math 70 repository!

I'm Alex, and this is a repository for my Math 70 (Elements of Multivariate Statistics & Statistical Learning) course at Dartmouth. I'm taking this course in the Spring 2023 term for my mathematical data science major. I'm excited to learn about statistics and data science!
