# Problem 1

## Instructions

The file `amazshop.csv` contains the following information on $1000$ Amazon.com shoppers: `shop=1` indicates the internal definition of active shoppers and `0` otherwise, `age`, `sex=1` codes male and `0` female, `total` contains the dollar amount spent during the year, and `npurch` indicates the number of items sold.

#### (a)

Run logistic regression on the four variables and develop a parsimonious model by selecting only statistically significant variables.

#### (b)

Test the hypothesis on the validity of the logistic regression using the likelihood ratio test by testing that all slope coefficients are zero.

#### (c)

Plot the probability to be qualified as an active shopper versus total amount for the shopper of age $20$ and age $60$.

#### (d)

Compute and display the $95\%$ confidence interval for the probability of a person who spends $\$2000$ per year and is $60$ years old.

#### (e)

Compute and display the ROC curves along with AUCs for identification of an inactive shopper for full and parsimonious model using different color.

## Solution

# Problem 2

## Instructions

#### (a)

Apply PCA to project the iris data onto the plane, display and color each flower.

#### (b)

Compute and display on each axis the proportion of variance explained and two components together on the top of the graph. Use `legend` for flower colors.

#### (c)

Display the proportion of variance explained by PCA projections as in `swiss(job=3)`.
